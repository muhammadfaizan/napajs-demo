# NAPA.JS DEMO

## There is a sunnah: Start from the easiest task.
So I am starting from the very basic example that they provided and try to learn from it.

### Example-1
#### Output

I think the output is funnyy, as it logged "hello world" 4 times without linefeed and then pushes all 4 linefeeds "\n" are pushed together, and after that it logs "hello napa" in the end. Well I tried running it again and got a different output, this time it logged 3 "hello world" on different lines and 4th one followed 3rd one without a linefeed, and then hello napa was printed after 1 blank line space.
